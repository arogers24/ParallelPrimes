# ParallelPrimes

This is parallelized method of counting all prime numbers from 1 to 2,147,483,647 using Vectorization, Multithreading, Thread Pools, and the Sieve of Eratosthenes. I conducted this work alongside classmates Neil Kapur and Naila Thevenot as a final project for our COSC-273 Parallelized and Distributed Computing course.

To run the program, enter the following commands
'''
javac --add-modules jdk.incubator.vector *.java
java --add-modules jdk.incubator.vector PrimeTester
